### Included libraries

The following libraries are included:
* [Sticky-kit](http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/), which provides an easy way to
  attach elements to the page when the user scrolls such that the element is
  always visible. Author: Leaf Corcoran


### Dependencies

The Chameleon skin uses several other libraries. These, while not included
directly in, nor delivered with the code, are pulled in automatically by the
Composer tool during installation. These are:
* MediaWiki Bootstrap extension, which provides the Twitter Bootstrap
  framework (version 3) to other MediaWiki extensions and skins. Author: Stephan
  Gambke. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Bootstrap
* Twitter Bootstrap, the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for
  developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Maintained by the
  [TWBS core team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people). See
  http://getbootstrap.com/
* Glyphicons Halflings, a library of precisely prepared monochromatic icons
  and symbols contained in and delivered with the Twitter Bootstrap framework.
  Author: Jan Kovařík. See http://glyphicons.com/.
* Less.php, a PHP port of the official LESS processor. Author: Josh Schmidt.
  See https://github.com/oyejorge/less.php
* loads of other software that I either forgot, am not aware of or that should
  be obvious (e.g. PHP, MediaWiki, etc.)

### Thanks!

To all the above people and projects my sincere thanks. This skin would not be
possible without them.

If I forgot somebody, sorry. Please drop me a note, so I can add them here.
